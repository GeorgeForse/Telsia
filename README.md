Telsia provides a clean, fast, and highly customisable colour overlay for your web browser. It is designed to reduce eye strain and improve reading comfort, making it an essential tool for daily browsing and for users with visual sensitivities.

Telsia is a valuable aid for individuals with Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome, Dyslexia, Photophobia, Visual Stress and other conditions that affect reading on a screen.

Key Features:

- Full Colour Control: Select any colour with an intuitive picker or input a precise HEX code, such as one recommended by an optician or specialist.

- Precise Opacity Slider: Instantly adjust the filter's transparency from a subtle tint to a full block of colour.

- Blend Mode: Select a blend mode for the overlay to use. We recommend Normal for most people, but Multiply is best if you want to preserve contrast of dark text on light backgrounds.

- Zero Performance Impact: Telsia is incredibly lightweight and optimized for speed, ensuring it never slows down your browsing experience.

- Enterprise Management: Ideal for schools and businesses. System administrators can centrally configure and manage some of the extension's features and behaviour for their users.

- Make it yours: Choose from 8 different overlay presets or use your own.

Common Use Cases:

- Applying a specific reading-aid tint (e.g., yellow, blue, green).

- Reducing screen glare and setting brightness to below system minimums.

- Warming the screen colour at night (or any time of day, really) to reduce blue light exposure.
